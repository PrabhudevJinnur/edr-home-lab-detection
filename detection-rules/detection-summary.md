# Detection Summary – SOAR & EDR Lab

## Overview

This document summarizes how alerts were generated during the SOAR & EDR lab.

No custom detection rules were created. The lab relied on default detection logic within the EDR platform.

---

## Detection Behavior Observed

During simulated attack activity, the EDR platform generated alerts based on:

- Suspicious process execution
- Behavioral anomalies
- Known attack technique patterns

The alerts were automatically triggered by built-in detection capabilities.

---

## What Was Validated

- Endpoint telemetry was successfully collected.
- Detection logic identified suspicious activity.
- Alerts were generated in real time.
- Investigation workflow could be initiated from the alert.

---

## Key Learning

This lab demonstrated how pre-configured detection logic within an EDR platform can identify potentially malicious activity without requiring custom rule development.

It reinforced the importance of understanding how default detection mechanisms operate before attempting rule customization.
